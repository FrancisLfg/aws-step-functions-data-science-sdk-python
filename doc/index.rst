AWS Step Functions Data Science Python SDK
##########################################

The AWS Step Functions Data Science SDK is an open source library that allows data
scientists to easily create workflows that process and publish machine learning
models using AWS SageMaker and AWS Step Functions. You can create
multi-step machine learning workflows in Python that orchestrate AWS
infrastructure at scale, without having to provision and integrate the AWS
services separately.

In addition to creating production-ready workflows directly in Python, the AWS
Step Functions Data Science SDK allows you to copy that workflow, experiment with
new options, and then put the refined workflow in production.
