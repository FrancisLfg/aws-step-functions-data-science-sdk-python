This section describes the recommended process of verifying the validity of the
AWS Data Science Workflows Python SDK's compiled distributions on
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/stepfunctions/>`__.

Whenever you download an application from the internet, we recommend that you
authenticate the identity of the software publisher and check that the
application is not altered or corrupted since it was published. This protects
you from installing a version of the application that contains a virus or other
malicious code.

If after running the steps in this topic, you determine that the distribution
for the AWS Data Science Workflows Python SDK is altered or corrupted, do NOT
install the package. Instead, contact AWS Support (https://aws.amazon.com/contact-us/).

AWS Data Science Workflows Python SDK distributions on PyPI are signed using
GnuPG, an open source implementation of the Pretty Good Privacy (OpenPGP)
standard for secure digital signatures. GnuPG (also known as GPG) provides
authentication and integrity checking through a digital signature. For more
information about PGP and GnuPG (GPG), see http://www.gnupg.org.

The first step is to establish trust with the software publisher. Download the
public key of the software publisher, check that the owner of the public key is
who they claim to be, and then add the public key to your keyring. Your keyring
is a collection of known public keys. After you establish the authenticity of
the public key, you can use it to verify the signature of the application.

2. `Authenticating and Importing the Public Key <#authenticating-and-importing-the-public-key>`__
3. `Verify the Signature of the Package <#verify-the-signature-of-the-package>`__

Installing the GPG Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your operating system is Linux or Unix, the GPG tools are likely already
installed. To test whether the tools are installed on your system, type
**gpg** at a command prompt. If the GPG tools are installed, you see a GPG
command prompt. If the GPG tools are not installed, you see an error stating
that the command cannot be found. You can install the GnuPG package from a
repository.

**To install GPG tools on Debian-based Linux**

From a terminal, run the following command: **apt-get install gnupg**

**To install GPG tools on Red Hatâ€“based Linux**

From a terminal, run the following command: **yum install gnupg**

Authenticating and Importing the Public Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next step in the process is to authenticate the AWS Data Science Workflows
Python SDK public key and add it as a trusted key in your GPG keyring.

To authenticate and import the AWS Data Science Workflows Python SDK public key

1. Copy the key from the following text and paste it into a file called
`data_science_workflows.key`. Make sure to include everything that follows:

2. At a command prompt in the directory where you saved
`data_science_workflows.key`, use the following command to import the AWS Data
Science Workflows Python SDK public key into your keyring:

.. code-block:: text

  gpg --import data_science_workflows.key

The command returns results that are similar to the following:

.. code-block:: text

  gpg: key 60EB103AE314A809: public key "Stepfunctions-Python-SDK-Signing <stepfunctions-developer-experience@amazon.com>" imported
  gpg: Total number processed: 1
  gpg:               imported: 1

Make a note of the key value; you need it in the next step. In the preceding
example, the key value is 60EB103AE314A809.

3. Verify the fingerprint by running the following command, replacing key-value
with the value from the preceding step:

.. code-block:: text

  gpg --fingerprint <key-value>

This command returns results similar to the following:

.. code-block:: text

  pub   rsa4096 2019-10-31 [SC] [expires: 2030-10-31] CC16 0577 B7BF 9D3D 6E5D
  51C5 60EB 103A E314 A809 uid           [ unknown]
  Stepfunctions-Python-SDK-Signing
  <stepfunctions-developer-experience@amazon.com> sub   rsa4096 2019-10-31 [E]
  [expires: 2030-10-31]

Additionally, the fingerprint string should be identical to CC16 0577 B7BF
9D3D 6E5D  51C5 60EB 103A E314 A809, as shown in the preceding example.
Compare the key fingerprint that is returned to the one published on this
page. They should match. If they don't match, don't install the AWS Data
Science Workflows Python SDK package, and contact AWS Support.

Verify the Signature of the Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After you install the GPG tools, authenticate and import the AWS Data Science
Workflows Python SDK public key, and verify that the public key is trusted, you
are ready to verify the signature of the package.

To verify the package signature, do the following.

1. Download the detached signature for the package from PyPI

  Go to the downloads section for the Data Science Workflows Python SDK
  https://pypi.org/project/stepfunctions/#files on PyPI, Right-click on the SDK
  distribution link, and choose "Copy Link Location/Address".

  Append the string ".asc" to the end of the link you copied, and paste this
  new link on your browser.

  Your browser will prompt you to download a file, which is the detatched
  signature associated with the respective distribution. Save the file on your
  local machine.

2. Verify the signature by running the following command at a command prompt
in the directory where you saved signature file and the AWS Data Science
Workflows Python SDK installation file. Both files must be present.

.. code-block:: text

  gpg --verify <path-to-detached-signature-file>

The output should look something like the following:

.. code-block:: text

  gpg: Signature made Thu 31 Oct 12:14:53 2019 PDT
  gpg:                using RSA key CC160577B7BF9D3D6E5D51C560EB103AE314A809
  gpg: Good signature from "Stepfunctions-Python-SDK-Signing <stepfunctions-developer-experience@amazon.com>" [unknown]
  gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
  gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
  Primary key fingerprint: CC16 0577 B7BF 9D3D 6E5D  51C5 60EB 103A E314 A809

If the output contains the phrase Good signature from "AWS Data Science
Workflows Python SDK <stepfunctions-developer-experience@amazon.com>", it means
that the signature has successfully been verified, and you can proceed to run
the AWS Data Science Workflows Python SDK package.

If the output includes the phrase BAD signature, check whether you performed the
procedure correctly. If you continue to get this response, don't run the
installation file that you downloaded previously, and contact AWS Support.

The following are details about the warnings you might see:

.. code-block:: text

  WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature! There is no
  indication that the signature belongs to the owner. This refers to your
  personal level of trust in your belief that you possess an authentic public
  key for AWS Data Science Workflows Python SDK. In an ideal world, you would
  visit an AWS office and receive the key in person. However, more often you
  download it from a website. In this case, the website is an AWS website.

  gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found. This means that the specific key is not
  "ultimately trusted" by you (or by other people whom you trust).

For more information, see http://www.gnupg.org.
